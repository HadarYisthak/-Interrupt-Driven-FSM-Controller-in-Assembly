# -Interrupt-Driven-FSM-Controller-in-Assembly
An interrupt-driven embedded system for the MSP430G2553, based on an FSM architecture. Four push-buttons trigger unique LED patterns or signal outputs. The system starts in sleep mode, resumes from the last state, and uses a modular, layered Assembly code structure.
